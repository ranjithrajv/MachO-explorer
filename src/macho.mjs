/**
 * macho.mjs — a Mach-O reader.
 *
 * Fat-header parsing, load commands, symbol tables, `__TEXT` literal search and
 * file-offset-to-vaddr mapping. It knows nothing about any application; it knows
 * about the file format.
 *
 * ## Why this is one module
 *
 * These tools were written one at a time and each grew its own reader. They
 * diverged, and the divergence produced bugs that no amount of testing on the
 * binary the tools were written for would have found:
 *
 *   - one tool hardcoded `const SLICE = 0x4000` — one binary's x86_64 slice
 *     offset inside its own fat header, correct for exactly one file on earth.
 *     Against any other universal binary it read load commands out of the middle
 *     of a data section and returned a confident, wrong answer.
 *   - another read the architecture list at a fixed offset, which is only right
 *     for a *thin* Mach-O, so on a universal binary its section walk silently
 *     failed and it scanned a default window containing nothing.
 *   - a third treated an absent architecture as fatal rather than a preference,
 *     so it failed outright on an arm64-only binary.
 *
 * Every one of those is a *parse* bug, and they were only reachable by pointing
 * a tool at a binary it was not written for. Centralising the parsing is what
 * makes them fixable once.
 *
 * ## Why the fat header is parsed rather than assumed
 *
 * A universal binary's slices sit at offsets given by the fat header, and those
 * offsets depend on the order and number of architectures in the build. There
 * is no default, and the numbers vary far enough to matter: in one measured
 * pair the slices sat at 0x4000 and 0xf16c000. A reader that assumed 0x4000
 * would work on that binary and nowhere else.
 *
 * ## Which slice to use
 *
 * Not "the first one". A universal binary can be stripped on one architecture
 * and not the other, so `richestSlice` takes the one with the most symbols and
 * `preferredSlice` treats a requested architecture as a preference that falls
 * back to the richest rather than a requirement that returns null.
