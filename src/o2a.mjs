/**
 * o2a.mjs — which virtual address does this byte of the file have?
 *
 *   macho-explorer o2a <offset> [<offset> ...] [--json] [--arch=<name>]
 *   macho-explorer o2a 0x1000 -b /path/to/binary
 *
 * The inverse of `a2o`. Offsets are accepted in hex with an `0x` prefix or in
 * decimal, and every positional is an offset — the binary comes from `-b`, for
 * the same reason `symlookup` does it that way: a path cannot be told apart from
 * a number by position, and guessing from its shape turns a typo into a
 * confident wrong answer.
 *
 * ## Offsets are absolute; the section table is not
 *
 * A `section_64`'s `offset` is relative to the start of its *slice*, so on a
 * universal binary a relative offset and a position in the file are different
 * numbers. In `/bin/ls` the x86_64 slice begins at 0x4000 and the arm64 slice at
 * 0x10000, so the same relative offset names different bytes in each. Both bases
 * are reported per slice, and `--arch` picks one.
 *
 * Every slice is examined and each answer attributed, because a hit's meaning
 * depends on which slice it came from — the same file offset is a different
 * address in each. On a well-formed fat binary the slices do not overlap, so at
 * most one maps any given offset; where more than one does, that is reported
 * rather than resolved.
 *
 * ## Offsets that map to nothing
 *
 * The header and the load commands are inside `__TEXT`'s segment range but
 * outside every section, so they resolve to an address with no section name.
 * Past the end of the file, nothing maps at all. Both are answers: the first is
 * a real address with no section, the second is a negative result and exits 1.
