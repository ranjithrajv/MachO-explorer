/**
 * describe.mjs — what is in this binary?
 *
 *   node src/describe.mjs [binary|bundle] [--json]
 *
 * Every slice, with its architecture, file extent, whether it is thin or part of
 * a fat file, symbol counts, where its `__TEXT` starts, and how many sections
 * are flagged as instructions.
 *
 * ## Why this tool exists
 *
 * It is the first thing to run on a binary you know nothing about, and it is the
 * answer to the question every one of the other five tools defers: which slice
 * will they actually read, and is there a symbol table to read?
 *
 * Before this existed, that information was scattered. `symgrep` printed its
 * choice in a trailing summary line, `findcall` printed one line per slice it
 * scanned, `mapliteral` printed its own, and `symfind` printed nothing at all.
 * Four tools, four formats, none of them machine-readable — so a script that
 * wanted to know what it had in front of it had to parse English from whichever
 * tool happened to mention it, or open the file itself and parse the fat header,
 * which is the very thing `macho.mjs` exists so nobody has to do twice.
 *
 * It is also the cheapest way to see the `__TEXT`-is-not-all-code point: the
 * `code sections` column is usually much smaller than the file, and the gap is
 * the data that an untyped scan used to report as call sites.
