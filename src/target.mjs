/**
 * target.mjs — find the binary a command should read.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Tools that read a Mach-O were written one at a time, and each grew its own
 * notion of "the binary": some took a path, some hardcoded one, and one read
 * the architecture's load commands at a fixed file offset, which is correct
 * only for a *thin* Mach-O and silently wrong on every universal binary. Two of
 * them could not terminate. Centralising the path resolution and the slice
 * choice here is what made those fixable in one place.
 *
 * ## Resolution order
 *
 *   1. an explicit argument, where the tool accepts one
 *   2. `$MACHO_EXPLORER_BINARY` — a path to an executable
 *   3. `$MACHO_EXPLORER_APP`   — a bundle; the executable is found inside it
 *   4. that tool's own fallback, so a bare invocation still finds something
 *
 * Step 4 is why each tool may pass its own default rather than sharing one
 * global: the fallbacks differ per tool, and silently unifying them would change
 * what a bare invocation does.
 *
 * Two names that used to be honoured as aliases for 2 and 3 were removed. They
 * named a specific commercial product, and this package deliberately knows
 * nothing about any application — an inherited convention from a caller is not
 * a good enough reason for a published tool to carry a vendor's name in its
 * public interface. A caller that used them can set `MACHO_EXPLORER_BINARY`/`MACHO_EXPLORER_APP`
 * instead; there is no behaviour here that depended on the old spelling.
 *
 * ## A bundle, not just a path
 *
 * `resolveBinary` handles application bundles, because that is what a person has:
 * the executable sits at `Contents/MacOS/<bundle name minus .app>`, and the bundle
 * name is not always the executable name.
 *
 * The `.app` convention is *data* rather than an assumption baked into the code
 * path, for the same reason the container layout is configurable elsewhere in this
 * workspace: it is a fact about macOS, not about how to read a Mach-O. On a
 * platform with no bundles — or with bundles laid out differently — the
 * separators, the `Contents` level and the executable directory all come from one
 * place, so pointing these tools at a bundle elsewhere is a config change rather
 * than a code change.
 *
 * ## About the fallback
 *
 * A bare invocation should not be a dead end, so the last resort is a system
 * binary that exists on every machine this runs on. It is a fallback, not a
 * default target — nothing here is *meant* to be pointed at it — and it is a
 * single named constant so overriding it is one edit rather than a search.
 *
 * It is a file rather than an `.app` on purpose. An earlier choice named an
 * application bundle, which was wrong twice over: it made this module refer to a
 * product, and the bundle turned out not to exist on the machine it was written
 * on, so every bare invocation failed with "no binary found".

 *
 * It is worth recording how that copy broke a second time after being deleted:
 * the function stayed in the file but its module-level constants did not, so it
 * threw a `ReferenceError` on every call — and its own `catch { return false }`
 * swallowed it. Every binary was reported as "not a Mach-O" and every tool
 * exited cleanly saying it could not find one. A catch that hides programming
 * errors turns a crash into a wrong answer, which is much harder to notice.

 * This exists for one specific mistake, and it is the reason the two checks

 * should I read", and when the answer would otherwise be a fallback it is
 * *correct* to fall back. This answers the prior question — "was this argument
 * meant to be a binary at all" — which has to be asked before falling back,
 * because a fallback answers about a file the caller never named.
 *
 * `sym /path/to/SomeBinary` was the observed case: `sym` takes a pattern then a
 * binary, so a lone path became the *pattern*, the binary defaulted, and the
 * tool reported a confident negative about `/bin/ls` while naming the file the
 * user had actually asked about nowhere in the output. Exit 1, no error, wrong
 * file — which is the shape README.md calls out as the thing this project exists
 * to avoid, appearing in the one command a new user is most likely to run first.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: it only fires on a lone Mach-O or bundle path, so a
 * pattern that merely *looks* like a path still searches normally. That is why
 * `findliteral` and `mapliteral` do not use it — a literal that is also a real
 * file is not a mistake, and refusing it would break a legitimate search.
