/**
 * output.mjs — argument parsing and JSON emission, shared by every tool.
 *
 * ## Why `--json` lives here rather than in each tool
 *
 * Each tool already had its own argument handling, and each did it slightly
 * differently: some read positionals by index, some filtered out anything
 * starting with `--`, and none of them could produce machine-readable output.
 * That is the state these tools were in for their entire life, and it is why
 * they were only usable by a person at a terminal.
 *
 * `--json` changes what the tools are *for*. The text output is a report; a
 * report is something a person reads. Structured output is something a script,
 * a pipeline or an agent consumes, and it is what makes these tools composable
 * with anything else rather than terminal-only. It is also the cheapest
 * possible path to "ask a question of a 476 MB binary in a shell pipeline":
 *
 *     node src/findcall.mjs --json 0x100085c30 /usr/local/go/bin/go | jq '.hits | length'
 *
 * ## The contract
 *
 * Two guarantees, because a consumer that has to work around them will not
 *   1. **stdout is JSON only.** Progress lines, the per-slice narration and the
 *      "none found" prose all go to stderr under `--json`. This matters more
 *      than it looks: it is the difference between `tool --json | jq` working
 *      and it silently reading its own diagnostics as data.
 *   2. **It is one object, always.** Envelope shape, not a bare array, so a
 *      consumer can read `.tool`, `.ok` and `.warnings` on a failure without
 *      first guessing what a success looks like.
 *
 * Addresses are emitted as `"0x..."` strings rather than JSON numbers. A 64-bit
 * vaddr does not survive `Number` — anything above 2^53 loses its low bits —
 * and a silent precision loss in the tool's output would be indistinguishable
 * from a correct answer. This is exactly the class of bug the rest of this
 * project exists to avoid, so it is fixed at the boundary rather than left to
 * whoever writes the consumer.
 */

/**
 * Envelope keys every tool emits, so consumers can rely on the shape.
 *
 * Nine tools, and `sym` is one of them rather than the two it replaced: the
 * `symgrep`/`symfind` pair went away with the merge rather than being kept as
 * aliases, so neither name can appear here any more.
 *
 * The list is the suite's roster: `smoke.mjs` walks it to check that every tool
 * answers `--help`, and refuses unknown flags, on the reasoning that a tool whose
 * one universally-required flag reports a usage error is the wrong shape for the
 * first thing anyone runs. A tool that exists but is not on this list gets none
 * of that, so being added here is part of being added at all.

 * Flags that take a separate value, so `-b /bin/ls` consumes `/bin/ls`.

 * "addresses must be hex: got /bin/ls". A usage error naming the wrong problem
 * is worse than no usage error, because it sends the reader looking in the
 * wrong place.
 *
 * `count` and `bytes` are here for the same reason as `max`: they take a
 * number, and a number in the wrong slot reads as a perfectly plausible address
 * or path. Keeping the list here rather than per-tool is what makes that a
 * single edit instead of one per tool that later grows a numeric flag.
 *
 * `min` was missing, and the omission was live in both tools that take it:
 * `findliteral --strings --min 9 <binary>` and `overview --strings --min 9
 * <binary>` both read `9` as the binary and failed with "9: cannot be read",
 * because `--min=9` worked and the space form did not — so a flag documented
 * with an `=` in one place silently misparsed in another. The asymmetry was the
 * bug: a flag that only works one way is a trap for anyone who types the other.

 * The version of the JSON envelope this build emits.

 * ## Why a version at all
 *
 * The envelope is the package's only stable surface. `--json` is how every tool is
 * scripted and how the MCP server answers an agent, so once anything consumes it,
 * changing a field name or a meaning is a breaking change whether or not the
 * package.json version says so. A consumer that cannot detect that will keep
 * parsing and quietly believe the wrong thing — which is the failure this project
 * exists to prevent, arrived at through a dependency instead of through a typo.
 *
 * So the version travels *in* every response rather than in documentation beside it.
 * A consumer pins the value it was written against and fails loudly on a change,
 * instead of discovering it from an empty field.
 *
 * ## When to bump it
 *
 * Bump the **major** on a removal, a rename, or a change of meaning. Bump the
 * **minor** when a field is added, since an added field is ignorable and existing
 * consumers keep working. Nothing else warrants a bump — in particular, a new tool
 * is not a change to the envelope, which is the point of having one envelope.
 *
 * Kept as a string rather than a number so `1.10` sorts after `1.9` to a reader as
 * well as to a version comparison, and so it can never be compared with `>` by a
 * consumer that forgets the coercion.
