/**
 * api.mjs — the supported programmatic interface.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The six CLIs were the only interface. Each reimplemented what it needed from
 * the file format, and they diverged in ways that were not merely inelegant:
 *
 *   - `symfind.mjs` and `symlookup.mjs` each parsed `LC_SYMTAB` by hand rather
 *     than calling `readSymbols`, so `symgrep` filtered to defined symbols while
 *     they reported imports alongside them.
 *   - `mapliteral.mjs` reimplemented the fat-header walk *and* hardcoded
 *     `if (cputype === 0x01000007)`, then threw `'x86_64 slice not found'` on an
 *     arm64-only binary — the exact "absent architecture is fatal" defect the
 *     rest of the project fixed and the smoke test guards against. It escaped
 *     because it did not share the reader, which is precisely the argument for
 *     sharing it.
 *
 * The README has always said this reader is meant to be imported or vendored,
 * and LGPL-3.0 §4d1 exists so that embedding it does not infect the embedding
 * application. None of that is usable while the only way in is to spawn a
 * subprocess and parse English. This module makes the licence rationale and the
 * "it is a reader, not a script" claim the same thing.
 *
 * ## Shape of every result
 *
 * Each function returns a plain object and throws nothing for ordinary
 * negative answers: no match is `{ matches: [] }`, not an exception. A caller
 * asking "does this binary call X" wants `false`, not a stack trace. Genuine
 * I/O failures do throw, because a caller that cannot distinguish "no result"
 * from "could not look" has the problem this project keeps fixing.
 *
 * Addresses come back as BigInt, matching `macho.mjs`. They do not fit in a
 * JSON number and must not be silently truncated; `output.mjs` renders them as
 * hex strings when a caller asks for JSON.
 *
 * ## Stability
 *
 * The exports here are the package's public surface and follow semver.
 * `macho.mjs` is also importable, but new format support lands there first, so
 * it is treated as lower-level: stable within a major version, more likely to
 * grow.

 *     bad regex is a worse failure than one that matches too much.
 *   - `definedOnly` defaults to true: an imported name carries no address and no
 *     implementation, so it is not an answer to "where is this implemented".
 *   - `dedupe` defaults to true: one name is one row, because a symbol table
 *     routinely carries a name at several addresses (aliases, thunks, per-arch
 *     copies) and nine rows saying `memcpy` is harder to read than one.

 *
 * `findliteral` searches for bytes the caller already knows. This finds strings
 * nobody has to know in advance, which is the other direction: the __cstring
 * section of a binary is a table of things it says, and reading it needs no
 * prior hypothesis. `ipsw macho info --strings` prints cstrings too, so this is
 * not a capability it lacks — the difference is that every string here carries
 * its **file offset, virtual address and owning section**, which is what makes a
 * string actionable rather than merely visible. A string you cannot address is
 * a string you cannot hand to `symlookup` or `mapliteral`.
 *
 * ## What counts as a string
 *
 * A run of at least `min` printable bytes terminated by NUL. Deliberately not
 * UTF-8 validation: a C string is a byte sequence between NULs, and rejecting
 * anything that is not valid UTF-8 would silently drop the Swift and ObjC
 * material that lives in `__cstring` and is full of non-ASCII.
