/**
 * a2o.mjs — which byte of the file is this virtual address?
 *
 *   macho-explorer a2o <hex-vaddr> [<hex-vaddr> ...] [--json] [--arch=<name>]
 *   macho-explorer a2o 0x100001000 -b /path/to/binary
 *
 * The inverse of `o2a`. Every address a tool reports is a virtual address,
 * because that is what a call site or a symbol refers to; every position a hex
 * editor, a `dd` pipeline or a patch script wants is a file offset. Converting
 * between them by hand means reading the section table, and the section table is
 * where the slice-relative-offset bug in this project's own history lived.
 *
 * ## Both offsets, always
 *
 * `offset` is slice-relative, matching what the section table records, and
 * `absoluteOffset` adds the slice's own position in the file. On a thin binary
 * they are the same. On a universal binary they are not, and reporting only one
 * of them is how a reader ends up editing the wrong bytes: in `/bin/ls`, the
 * x86_64 slice starts at 0x4000, so `__TEXT` at relative 0 is absolute 0x4000.
 *
 * ## Zero-fill is an answer, not a gap
 *
 * `__bss` and `__noptrbss` have addresses and sizes but no bytes in the file —
 * the loader supplies zeros — and `__PAGEZERO` is 4 GB of address space with
 * nothing behind it. An address there is *mapped*, so reporting "not found"
 * would be wrong, and reporting a file offset would be worse: there is no byte
 * to read. Those come back as `zerofill: true` with a note, which is a third
 * answer distinct from both "mapped to a byte" and "not in this binary".
 *
 * The inverse direction has the matching trap. `toVaddr` used to test sections
 * before checking whether they occupy file bytes, and `__DATA,__bss` — whose
 * recorded offset is 0 — swallowed the first 180,760 bytes of every binary.
 * File offset 0x1000, the first byte of `__text`, came back as being inside
 * `__bss`. See `isBackedByFile` in `macho.mjs`.
