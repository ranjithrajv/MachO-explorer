/**
 * sym.mjs — search a Mach-O symbol table.
 *
 *   node src/sym.mjs <pattern> [binary|bundle] [max] [--json] [--regex]
 *   node src/sym.mjs --all-imp 'malloc' /path/to/binary
 *   node src/sym.mjs --regex 'runtime\..*main' /usr/local/go/bin/go
 *
 * ## This tool used to be two
 *
 * `symgrep.mjs` searched by regex and `symfind.mjs` by substring, and they
 * disagreed about what a symbol search meant. `symgrep` returned defined symbols
 * only and one row per table entry; `symfind` included imports and collapsed a
 * name to one row. Neither default was a mistake — they were answers to
 * different questions that had drifted into looking like the same tool, and a
 * reader who had learned one had to check which convention the other used before
 * trusting a result. They are now one tool with one stated set of rules, and the
 * two old names still work (see *The old names* below).
 *
 * ## The rules, stated once
 *
 *   - **Substring by default.** The name is usually known but not its exact
 *     spelling, and a pattern that accidentally fails to compile as a regex is a
 *     worse failure than one that matches too much. `--regex` switches.
 *   - **Defined symbols only, unless you ask otherwise.** An imported name
 *     carries `n_value == 0`: it says which library a call goes out to, not
 *     where anything is implemented. `--all-imp` includes them, and they are
 *     marked `(import)` rather than printed as `0x0`, because a bare zero reads
 *     as "defined at address zero" — the confusion that once made `symlookup`
 *     answer `function: _write, starts: 0x0` for a stub binary.
 *   - **One row per name.** A symbol table routinely carries one name at several
 *     addresses (aliases, thunks, per-architecture copies), and nine rows
 *     reading `memcpy` is harder to read than one. `--no-dedupe` restores the
 *     raw per-entry form.
 *
 * ## The old names
 *
 * `symgrep.mjs` and `symfind.mjs` are gone rather than kept as aliases. Nothing
 * in this package called them except the tools themselves, the package is at
 * 0.1.0, and two superseded entry points that disagree with the rules above
 * would recreate exactly the ambiguity the merge exists to end. The
 * equivalents are `sym.mjs --regex` and `sym.mjs --all-imp`, which is why the
 * defaults above are the opposite way round from `symgrep`'s.
 *
 * ## A bug this no longer has
 *
 * This lineage used to open the file and hardcode `const SLICE = 0x4000` as the
 * base for every load-command read. 0x4000 is not "the Mach-O", it is the byte
 * offset of one binary's x86_64 slice inside its own fat header — correct for
 * exactly one file on earth. In the measured pair, the other slice sat at
 * 0xf16c000. Against any other binary it read load commands out of the middle of
 * a data section, and the failure mode was a plausible-looking wrong answer
 * rather than an error. The slice now comes from `api.mjs`, which shares one
 * reader with the other tools.
