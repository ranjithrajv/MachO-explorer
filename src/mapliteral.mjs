/**
 * mapliteral.mjs — map a literal to its addresses, and find what points at them.
 *
 *   macho-explorer mapliteral <literal> [binary|bundle] [file-offset ...] [--json]
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1. parse the fat header and choose a slice
 *   2. locate the literal (or use the offsets given)
 *   3. map each hit to a virtual address and say which section it is in
 *   4. search the whole file for pointers to those addresses, which reveals the
 *      descriptor or vtable tables hanging off them
 *
 * Step 4 is the point of the tool. A format magic in read-only data is a label;
 * the *pointers* to it are the handler. Finding the pointer tables is how you
 * learn which code compares against the magic, and from there where the decoder
 * lives.
 *
 * The literal is an argument, not a constant, and the offsets are optional. An
 * earlier version took its two input offsets as hardcoded values recorded by hand
 * from one binary, which made it a script about that binary wearing a generic
 * name. Everything here except the needle is application independent.
 *
 * ## The bug this no longer has
 *
 * This tool used to reimplement the fat-header walk *and* hardcode
 * `if (cputype === 0x01000007) slice = ...`, then `throw new Error('x86_64 slice
 * not found')` when no x86_64 slice existed. On an arm64-only binary — which is
 * every Apple-silicon-native build — it did not degrade, it died, with a message
 * that said the file was wrong rather than that the tool was. That is the same
 * "absent architecture is fatal" defect the rest of the project fixed, and it
 * survived here for exactly one reason: this file had its own copy of the reader
 * instead of sharing one. It shares one now, so there is no second copy to be
 * wrong in a different way.
