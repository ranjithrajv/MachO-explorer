/**
 * mcp-tools.mjs — the tool surface, as data plus handlers.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists separately from the protocol
 *
 * `mcp.mjs` is JSON-RPC and era negotiation, and it should stay that way. What a
 * tool *is* — its name, what it is for, what it refuses to do, what shape its
 * arguments take — is a different concern with a different rate of change, and
 * putting the two together is how a protocol file grows a 300-line tool table
 * nobody can review.
 *
 * ## One tool per question
 *
 * Eight tools, matching the eight CLIs, because a model picks a tool by reading a
 * description and a tool that answers two questions answers neither one well.
 * There is deliberately no combined "inspect this binary" tool: an agent that
 * wants the slice list, an address lookup and its callers is three calls, and
 * each of those is cheap enough that bundling them saves a round trip at the
 * cost of a schema that says "and also".
 *
 * ## What an agent cannot be trusted to know
 *
 * Three things, and every tool description says them, because a model that does
 * not know them will confidently do the wrong thing:
 *
 *   1. **Addresses are hex strings.** `"0x100085c30"`, never a JSON number. A
 *      64-bit vaddr does not survive a double, and an agent that sends
 *      `1091523120` has silently lost the low bits before the file is opened.
 *      The schema enforces the `0x` form with a pattern, which is stronger than
 *      anything the CLI can do — see the note on silent flags in `CONTRIBUTING`.
 *   2. **A negative answer is not an error.** No matches returns a result with
 *      an empty list and `ok: true`. An agent that treats it as a failure will
 *      retry variations forever, so it is reported as a value.
 *   3. **Direct calls only.** Indirect and PLT calls do not encode their target
 *      in the instruction and are invisible here. `findcall` output is a
 *      shortlist of sites *worth* disassembling, not a call graph.
 *
 * ## Naming
 *
 * Unprefixed, matching the CLI verbs one-for-one (`describe`, `sym`, ...). The
 * server already scopes them, but the spec advises a prefix because a client
 * aggregating several servers can collide on a word like `describe`. Keeping one
 * vocabulary across the shell and an agent session was judged the stronger
 * property here.
 */

/**
 * Reason codes a handler may report. Shared with the CLIs, which emit the same
 * set, so `errors` means one thing across a shell pipeline and an agent session.
 *
 * The `no-*` codes are the CLIs' way of saying "ran fine, found nothing" — a
 * value, not a failure — and they stay listed because the CLIs emit them and the
 * output schema must permit them. **This layer does not put them in `errors`**,
 * because what a client branches on here is `isError`, and a model told a
 * literal is absent with `isError: true` goes looking for a different binary
 * instead of accepting the answer. Nothing-found arrives as a note, with
 * `data.count === 0` as the precise signal; `errors` is for failing to do the
 * job at all.
 */

/**
 * The one import this file has, and it is here for a specific reason.
 *
 * Everything else here is deliberately self-contained — the reason codes, the
 * validator, the schemas — because the MCP server is what an agent loads first and
 * a module graph it has to resolve is a module graph that can fail to load. But
 * `SCHEMA_VERSION` is the exception: a *version* is only a version if there is
 * exactly one of it. Restating the literal here would leave two constants free to
 * drift, and the CLI answering "1.0" while the server says "1.1" is a bug that
 * presents as a successful call and would be found by nobody.
