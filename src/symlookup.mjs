/**
 * symlookup.mjs — which function contains this virtual address?
 *
 *   macho-explorer symlookup <hex-vaddr> [<hex-vaddr> ...] [--json] [--arch=<name>]
 *   macho-explorer symlookup 0x100085c30 -b /path/to/binary
 *
 * `nm` on a large universal binary takes minutes, so this reads `LC_SYMTAB`
 * directly and binary-searches the nlist_64 array. That is the whole reason this
 * tool exists, and it is why the symbol filtering below is not an optimisation.
 *
 * ## Why there is no positional binary argument
 *
 * Every positional argument here is an address to resolve, so a path cannot be
 * told apart from a vaddr by position — it would have to be guessed from whether
 * it starts with `0x`, which is exactly the kind of inference that turns a typo
 * into a wrong answer. The binary comes from `-b`/`--binary`, `$MACHO_EXPLORER_BINARY` or
 * `$MACHO_EXPLORER_APP` instead, and the tool says which it used.
 *
 * ## The bug this no longer has
 *
 * This tool parsed `LC_SYMTAB` itself and then filtered candidates with
 * `(type & N_TYPE) !== N_SECT` *and* `value === 0n`. Both guards matter: only
 * removing one leaves the other blocking the imported symbols that carry the
 * defect, which is what made the first mutation check inconclusive.
 *
 * Imported symbols carry `n_value == 0`, so including them makes any low address
 * resolve to an import sitting at zero. That went unnoticed while this was only
 * pointed at one binary, whose million dense symbols meant the search always
 * landed on real code. Pointed at a dyld-cache stub — `/usr/bin/ssh` has 449
 * symbols of which exactly 1 is defined — the old code answered
 * `function: _write, starts: 0x0` for 0x1000, which is both wrong and
 * plausible-looking.
