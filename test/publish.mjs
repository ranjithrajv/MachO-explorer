/**
 * Can this package actually be published, and does it say what it publishes?
 *
 * `npm publish --dry-run` is the command that looks like this check and is not
 * one. It packs the tarball, prints `+ MachO-Tools@0.1.0` and exits 0 — on a name
 * npm refuses outright:
 *
 *     npm error 404 'MachO-Tools@*' is not in this registry.
 *     npm error 404 This package name is not valid, because
 *     npm error 404 1. name can no longer contain capital letters
 *
 * A dry run never asks the registry whether a name is acceptable, because a dry
 * run is not a publish. So the one command a maintainer reaches for reports
 * success on the one thing that was broken. This asserts the properties
 * directly instead.
 *
 * Run by `npm test` and by `.githooks/pre-push`, so it is checked on every
 * platform in CI rather than only on a maintainer's machine.
