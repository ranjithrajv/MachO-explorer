 * fixtures.mjs — build the test corpus, as Mach-O binaries written from scratch.
 *
 *   node test/fixtures.mjs            # write test/fixtures/*.macho
 *   node test/fixtures.mjs --check    # verify they match, write nothing
 *
 * ## Why the corpus is *built* rather than *collected*
 *
 * `smoke.mjs` originally ran against whatever binaries happened to be installed
 * on the machine: `/usr/bin/true`, `/usr/bin/ssh`, a Go toolchain, ffmpeg. That
 * has three problems, and they are all the same problem wearing different hats.
 *
 *   1. **The suite only exists where those binaries exist.** On a bare CI runner
 *      `discover()` returns nothing, the suite exits 2, and the honest answer —
 *      "I checked nothing" — is indistinguishable from a failure to run. Every
 *      result became machine-dependent, including the mutation check, which
 *      copies the tree and re-runs the suite inside the copy: on a machine
 *      without ffmpeg, the mutated tree "passed" because the mutation was never
 *      exercised, and reported that as a pass.
 *   2. **Nothing pins what is actually being tested.** The suite asserts that a
 *      "stub" and a "populated" binary were both covered, but which files those
 *      are is decided by `/usr/bin`. A binary that stops being stripped after an
 *      OS update quietly changes what the coverage assertions mean.
 *   3. **The interesting shapes are hard to find on a real machine.** The
 *      defects this project guards against need specific inputs: a fat binary
 *      whose slices sit at awkward offsets, an arm64-only binary, a slice with
 *      imported-but-addressless symbols, code and data in the *same* segment so
 *      a byte scan cannot tell them apart. Finding four real binaries with
 *      those properties is luck; building them is a page of arithmetic.
 *
 * So the corpus is generated, from code, in this file. That buys:
 *
 *   - **Portability.** The suite needs nothing but Node. It runs on a bare Linux
 *     container, on Windows, on a fresh checkout.
 *   - **Reviewability.** These are readable instructions, not opaque blobs. A
 *     reviewer can see that the x86_64 fixture contains exactly three direct
 *     calls and check the suite's claim against it.
 *   - **Sharpness.** Every fixture is minimal *on purpose*, so a failure points
 *     at one thing. A real Go toolchain fails somewhere and you go looking.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * Fixtures are a compiler's job. Assembling them by hand means writing correct
 * `rel32` and `BL` displacements and correct symbol tables, and a fixture whose
 * own encoding is wrong will produce a suite that passes for the wrong reason.
 * So this file encodes only what it can encode *exactly* and verify: headers,
 * fat tables, load commands, section layouts, symbol tables, and the few
 * instructions whose bytes are simple enough to write down and check by
 * reading. Every fixture is validated below before it is written — see
 * `verify()`, which re-reads each file with the project's own reader and
 * asserts the properties the suite depends on. A fixture that does not hold up
 * fails at build time rather than quietly weakening the suite.

 *   - section entries were not read at all (`if (wide)`), so a 32-bit slice
 *     reported zero sections and every address lookup in it said "not in a

 *   - `nlist` was read as 16 bytes with a 64-bit `n_value`, when the 32-bit form

 *
 *   - **platform.** A Mach-O from an iPhone and one from a Mac agree at every
 *     level this reader used to look at: same magic, same word size, same
 *     load-command shape. `LC_BUILD_VERSION` is the only thing that tells them
 *     apart, and without it a tool cannot say "this is an iOS binary" at all.
 *
 *   - **encryption.** App Store binaries ship with `__TEXT` encrypted and
 *     `cryptid` set to 1. A byte scanner that does not know this returns zero
 *     hits and reports "nothing calls this" — a claim about code that was never
 *     readable. The fixture does not encrypt its bytes; the *declaration* is the
 *     input that matters, because the defect is a scanner that trusts a zero.
 *
 * `cpusubtype` is 2 (`CPU_SUBTYPE_ARM64E`), so this is also the only fixture that
 * can catch `arm64e` being reported as plain `arm64` — they share a `cputype` and
 * differ only here, which is exactly why the type alone cannot name the slice.
