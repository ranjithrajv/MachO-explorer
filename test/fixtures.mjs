 * fixtures.mjs — build the test corpus, as Mach-O binaries written from scratch.
 *
 *   node test/fixtures.mjs            # write test/fixtures/*.macho
 *   node test/fixtures.mjs --check    # verify they match, write nothing
 *
 * ## Why the corpus is *built* rather than *collected*
 *
 * `smoke.mjs` originally ran against whatever binaries happened to be installed
 * on the machine: `/usr/bin/true`, `/usr/bin/ssh`, a Go toolchain, ffmpeg. That
 * has three problems, and they are all the same problem wearing different hats.
 *
 *   1. **The suite only exists where those binaries exist.** On a bare CI runner
 *      `discover()` returns nothing, the suite exits 2, and the honest answer —
 *      "I checked nothing" — is indistinguishable from a failure to run. Every
 *      result became machine-dependent, including the mutation check, which
 *      copies the tree and re-runs the suite inside the copy: on a machine
 *      without ffmpeg, the mutated tree "passed" because the mutation was never
 *      exercised, and reported that as a pass.
 *   2. **Nothing pins what is actually being tested.** The suite asserts that a
 *      "stub" and a "populated" binary were both covered, but which files those
 *      are is decided by `/usr/bin`. A binary that stops being stripped after an
 *      OS update quietly changes what the coverage assertions mean.
 *   3. **The interesting shapes are hard to find on a real machine.** The
 *      defects this project guards against need specific inputs: a fat binary
 *      whose slices sit at awkward offsets, an arm64-only binary, a slice with
 *      imported-but-addressless symbols, code and data in the *same* segment so
 *      a byte scan cannot tell them apart. Finding four real binaries with
 *      those properties is luck; building them is a page of arithmetic.
 *
 * So the corpus is generated, from code, in this file. That buys:
 *
 *   - **Portability.** The suite needs nothing but Node. It runs on a bare Linux
 *     container, on Windows, on a fresh checkout.
 *   - **Reviewability.** These are readable instructions, not opaque blobs. A
 *     reviewer can see that the x86_64 fixture contains exactly three direct
 *     calls and check the suite's claim against it.
 *   - **Sharpness.** Every fixture is minimal *on purpose*, so a failure points
 *     at one thing. A real Go toolchain fails somewhere and you go looking.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* here
 *
 * Fixtures are a compiler's job. Assembling them by hand means writing correct
 * `rel32` and `BL` displacements and correct symbol tables, and a fixture whose
 * own encoding is wrong will produce a suite that passes for the wrong reason.
 * So this file encodes only what it can encode *exactly* and verify: headers,
 * fat tables, load commands, section layouts, symbol tables, and the few
 * instructions whose bytes are simple enough to write down and check by
 * reading. Every fixture is validated below before it is written — see
 * `verify()`, which re-reads each file with the project's own reader and
 * asserts the properties the suite depends on. A fixture that does not hold up
 * fails at build time rather than quietly weakening the suite.

 *   - section entries were not read at all (`if (wide)`), so a 32-bit slice

 *      counts rather than of anything the file says.
 *   2. **misalignment.** 0x4200 is not a 16 KiB boundary, which is dyld's
 *      requirement. A warning rather than an error, because a reader that reads
 *      slice offsets from the table — as this one does — handles it correctly.
 *   3. **overrun.** The arm64 slice declares a size far past the end of the file,
 *      which is what a truncated or tampered container looks like.
 *
 * The consequence worth stating, because it is the whole argument for a
 * container-level check: **both slices still parse, and neither is flagged.**
 *
 * The arm64 slice lands 0x200 bytes into the x86_64 slice, so its bytes overwrite
 * the tail of x86_64's — which is where that slice's string table lives. The
 * x86_64 header, load commands and sections are all intact, so `parseThin`
 * succeeds and every per-slice check passes. What is left is a slice reporting
 * `nsyms: 6, defined: 0`: six symbol *entries* whose names have been destroyed by
 * the overlap. On its own that shape is indistinguishable from a stripped binary,
 * and `detectAbnormalities` has nothing to say about it — each slice is
 * internally consistent, and the inconsistency is between them.
 *
 * This is exactly the defect a per-slice check is structurally unable to find, and
 * it is why the container pass exists. An earlier draft of this fixture asserted
 * that the overlapping slice would simply fail to parse; it does not, and the
 * assertion was wrong. Overlapping slices are subtler than that.

/**
 * Was this file *run*, rather than imported?
 *
 * The obvious comparison — `path.resolve(process.argv[1])` against
 * `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` — is wrong whenever the two arrive by
 * different routes, and the commonest route is a symlink: `npm install` of a
 * local dependency links the package rather than copying it, so `argv[1]` is the
 * `node_modules/...` path while Node has already resolved `import.meta.url` to
 * the real one. The comparison then says "imported", `main` never runs, and the
 * script exits 0 having done nothing at all.
 *
 * That is the worst failure available here, because it looks exactly like
 * success. `node fixtures.mjs --check` on a drifted corpus has to fail; on a
 * symlinked path it used to pass without looking at anything. Realpath both
 * sides so the answer does not depend on how the file was reached.
