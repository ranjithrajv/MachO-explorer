/**
 * mutation-check.mjs — does smoke.mjs actually have teeth?
 *
 * A smoke test that passes proves nothing unless it fails when the thing it
 * guards is broken. This reintroduces each bug that `smoke.mjs` is supposed to
 * catch, one at a time, and asserts the test notices.
 *
 *   node test/mutation-check.mjs
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * The first attempt at verifying this was wrong in an instructive way. It
 * removed only the `N_SECT` filter from the symbol reader — and the test still
 * passed, because the *other* guard (`value === 0n`) independently blocks the
 * imported symbols that carry the bug. A green result from an incomplete mutation
 * is the most dangerous outcome here: it reads as "the test covers this" when it
 * establishes nothing at all. Reverting to the original behaviour faithfully —
 * both guards gone — made the test fail as it should.
 *
 * So each mutation below restores the actual original defect rather than
 * approximating it.
 *
 * ## It runs against the fixtures
 *
 * This used to depend on system binaries being installed, which made every
 * verdict machine-dependent: on a machine without ffmpeg the mutation was never
 * really exercised and the run reported it caught anyway. It now runs the suite
 * against the generated corpus, so a mutation that the fixtures detect is
 * detected everywhere. The generated corpus is rebuilt inside the mutated copy,
 * so the mutation cannot be dodged by leaving stale fixtures behind.
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * Every mutation is applied to a copy in a temp directory, never to the working
 * tree, and the copy runs the *installed* test against the *mutated* tool. The
 * working tree is not modified at any point, so there is nothing to restore and
 * no way for a crashed run to leave a mutated file behind — which is exactly how
 * the first verification left a source file broken with no restore step.
